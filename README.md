## 1. Situation
Analyzed survey data from **1,120 individual investors** to understand behavioral patterns, risk appetite, and asset allocation across varying demographics.
## 2. Task
The objective was to determine preferred investment avenues by gender and age (grouped into Early, Established, and Experienced Adulthood) and identify the primary factors driving financial decisions.
## 3. Action
Built a dynamic **Excel Dashboard** featuring custom slicers for Age Group, Source and Gender.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Used Pivot Charts to correlate Savings Objectives with Investment Duration.
* **Driver Analysis:** Analyzed the influence of expected returns on Mutual Fund choices.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Primary Driver:** "Returns" was identified as the dominant influencing factor, peaking at **448 responses** among Established Adults.
* **Long-term Motivation:** Investments greater than 5 years were overwhelmingly driven by **Retirement Plans (364 responses)**.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Targeted Marketing:** Tailor marketing messages for long-term investment products specifically around **Retirement Security** for the 26-30 age group (Established Adults), as this aligns with their primary motivation identified in the data.
